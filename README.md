# Weight-Tracker---Original
This artifact is from the CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming final project prior to adding my enhancements that were outilined in my example code reivew. The code review can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwx_MJLvxNQ). For this project we were given three options to design and create an Android application. I chose to create an app that allows the user to utilize CRUD operations in a daily weight tracker that would also display the delta from a user defined goal weight. This project was originally created in January of 2022.
